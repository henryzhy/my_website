#Introduction

## Purpose of Research

We always find it boring to see those number in Excel without plot or those plot without specific location infomation when checking the confirmed cases number online. So here, we would like to see how to combine those number with a map.

## Data Source

We collect data from the package named "nCov2019". It has lots of data about Covid-19 and is available in both Chinese and English.

## Packages

We mainly use a package called "nCov2019" which can be found in github. It is a package with auto updated data with comprehensive explanation.

We also introduce "magick" here, which we can use to make our plot fancy. It helps us to make sure our map is in the right shape.

We also use a package called "RColorBrewer" which we use to change the colour of different provinces to show how many cases they have until now.


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
library(readr)
library(lubridate)
library(magrittr)
library(tibble)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)
library(purrr)
library(gganimate)
library(gifski)
library(nCov2019)
library(magick)
library(tidyverse)
library(RColorBrewer)
```


# Generating data

```{r}
x <- get_nCov2019()     # get latest covid-19 data
province_data <- x[]       # generate province data
head(province_data)
```


# Map

```{r}
load("ProvinceMapDatas.Rda") 
```


# Combine map info with covid-19 info

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
df_China <- df_China %>%
  left_join(province_data, by=c("NAME"="name")) 

names(df_China)[16] <- "Confirm_cases"
```


# Plotting

```{r}
ggplot() +
  geom_polygon(data=df_China, 
               aes(x=long, y=lat, group=interaction(class, group), 
                   fill=`confirm.x`), colour="black", size=0.25) +  # plot Chinese map
  geom_rect(aes(xmin=124, xmax=124+9.3, ymin=16-0.3, ymax=16+9), 
            fill=NA, colour="black", size=0.25) +
  geom_line(data=df_NanHaiLine, aes(x=long, y=lat, group=ID), 
            colour="black", size=1) +  # make sure we draw the right border
  scale_fill_gradientn(colours=colorRampPalette(rev(brewer.pal(11,'Spectral')))(32),
                       name = "History \nCases",
                       limits = c(500,2000)) +
  coord_map() +  
  ylim(14, 54) +
  labs(x="Longitude", y="Latitude") +
  ggtitle("History Covid-19 Cases in China") +
  theme(
    plot.title=element_text(hjust=0.5),
    legend.position = c(0.1,0.2),
    legend.background = element_blank())+
  theme_bw()
```


# Conclusion

We can see the confirm cases plot in a Chinese map. We notice that east China has the most confirmed cases between 1,000 to 1,500 from February. West China is in good shape and witness cases under 1,000.
